      "content": "I have never been too good with spoken words. I need more time than the act of talking allows to process all the images or feelings that run through my head and body into a verbal form. And I have been hurting. For quite some time now. A heartache that refuses to heal and a grief that will only start loosen its grip when drowned in an abundance of alcohol. Which I have made use of way too often in these past six months. If your resting state is something that looks so scarily close to depression, it is dangerously easy to fall into a very dark place if bad things keep on happening to you and the people you care most about. \nThat is why on the second evening at the hospital, we ran out of words. Not that the words I was able to produce the day before had been of much quality. What do you say to your friend, whose mother is lying motionless in front of you, tied to a cobweb of cables and tubes, a hole in her head to drain the blood from her brain which forced her into this coma. Whose dad had just passed away a couple months prior, as suddenly and unexpected as the brain haemorrhage that brought his mother here. \nWhen I got home that night, I couldn't stop blaming myself for not knowing how to be of better comfort to him. How to be a better friend. This has been a theme that has haunted me over and over again during the course of this past year. Friends I couldn't hug because of the physical distance between us. Friends I couldn't reach and show how much I cared about them because of misinterpreted text messages. Friends who might never understand how fragile our friendship has become, because no phone call ever seems to be long enough to speak about it. It seems that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I can never get it right. No matter how deeply I care, caring will never be enough. Spiraling down this path of sad and depressive thinking, I instinctively reached for my journal. When I opened it, something caught my eye - a single sentence, a scribbled intention I had completely lost sight of. \nIt read: \"Be the brightest soul around.\" \nI instantly remembered when and why I wrote it. I had been reading a collection of poems by the late Mary Oliver, who I had only just been introduced to. All of her poetry has since had a huge impact on me, but on this day, it was the poem \"Sunrise\" that got this particular thought process going. The poem goes like this: \n\nYou can \ndie for it– \nan idea, \nor the world. People \nhave done so, \nbrilliantly, \nletting \ntheir small bodies be bound \nto the stake, \ncreating \nan unforgettable \nfury of light. But \nthis morning, \nclimbing the familiar hills \nin the familiar \nfabric of dawn, I thought \nof China, \nand India \nand Europe, and I thought \nhow the sun \nblazes \nfor everyone just \nso joyfully \nas it rises \nunder the lashes \nof my own eyes, and I thought \nI am so many! \nWhat is my name? \nWhat is the name \nof the deep breath I would take \nover and over \nfor all of us? Call it \nwhatever you want, it is \nhappiness, it is another one \nof the ways to enter \nfire. \n\nIt was the last two verses, the idea of happiness being the deep breath I would take over and over for all of us, that reminded me of a quote from another poem, this time by Jack Gilbert: \"We must risk delight. […] We must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world\". When you are a highly empathetic person, it is all too easy to completely lose yourself in the problems and feelings of the people and the world around you, even more so if your own mental state is not in the best of conditions to begin with. Often I will find myself caught up in such dark pessimism about the world that I will start to think that I am not entitled to happiness while so many other people suffer such devastating fates. This can go as far as me feeling almost guilty about experiencing a moment of happiness, when I know someone else is suffering. But in those moments, I keep forgetting what Jack Gilbert put like this: \"If we deny our happiness, resist our satisfaction, we lessen the importance of their deprivation.\" And: \"To make injustice the only measure of our attention is to praise the Devil\". \nEven though from time to time I will again fall into these unhealthy thought patterns, deep down I truly want to be the brightest soul around. I want to be a source of hope, and joy, and strength to the people around me. \nSo on this third day, I met my friend prepared. When our silence started to fill the room again, I reached into my bag and fished out the pile of books I had brought with me. Each of them a collection of poems, each of them carefully selected the night before, all of them filled with a sense of stubborn gladness, gratitude and hope. Without any permission, without a further word, I began to read them aloud. I read them to my friend and to his mother, hoping both or either one of them could find some form of comfort in the sound and the images the words produced. When I had read the last of the poems and closed the book in my hands, I smiled at my friend. His reaction was something I did not see coming. With an ernest expression on his face, he got up from his tiny hospital chair, came over to me and with his huge arms, proceeded to give me a hug, a kiss on the forehad, and said: \"thank you\". \nThis is not a miracle story. The poems I brought did not wake his mother or magically healed her. We are still waiting for her to wake up and for the diagnosis afterwards. But this uncommon outburst of affection from my friend, which surprised the both of us so much it made us laugh, was enough. On this third day, we filled the room with laughter instead of silence. We talked about the mysteries and beauty of this world, instead of its injustices and our broken hearts. I'd like to think this counts for something. I'd like to think, in our small way, we contributed something to this earthly life that hopefully makes his mother want to come back to. And that maybe, just this once, I was a good friend - and, if not the brightest, then at least one of the brighter souls around. \n\n\nIn loving memory of Inge."
